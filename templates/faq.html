              <p>
                A swimming pool is a large body of water and, as a result, the chemical makeup can be different in certain locations. For example, evaporation and other influences can make the water at the surface of the pool have a slightly different composition to that at the bottom.
                For the most accurate result, it's recommended that you take a sample from at least 20 cm from the surface of the pool (elbow-depth)

                If you are using test strips and getting no reading back from the water, this is often a result of chlorine levels. Sometimes, having a chlorine level that is too high can cause a bleaching effect on the strips, whereas having no chlorine can also impact other results.
If you believe you may have added too much chlorine, mix your water 50/50 with tap water to see if another test strip then produces a result. If it does, then you are likely to have too much chlorine.

              <p>One of the biggest reasons for inaccurate water testing results, besides where you take the water sample from, is time. Leaving your water sample exposed for too long before testing it can lead to inaccurate results.
                Similarly, when using a solution-based test, leaving the final solution for too long can lead to changes in the colour, giving inaccurate readings. Thankfully, simply performing the test as instructed without unintended breaks will remove this issue.</p>
